# Hacker Typer

Created in 2021 by Divyanshu Gupta, Hacker Typer arose from a simple desire to look like the stereotypical hacker in movies and pop culture. Plus, many of you have temporarily transformed into hackers yourselves, all from a few clicks on the keyboard (and some programming magic behind the scenes!)
