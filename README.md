# HackerTyper

Created in 2021 by Divyanshu Gupta, Hacker Typer arose from a simple desire to look like the stereotypical hacker in movies and pop culture. Plus, many of you have temporarily transformed into hackers yourselves, all from a few clicks on the keyboard (and some programming magic behind the scenes!).
Also, if you are using Hacker Typer in any of your projects, videos or images, feel free to reach out! It’s amazing to see what happens when people’s creativity interacts with this site.
You can Contribute to the Project if yoy feel like.
